Ideas:

	till climax meet between char1 and char2, char1 will not know the identity of char2 as the threat actor. upon meeting, 

{char1 asks char2 where she had been while his life was literally thrown inside out}, 
		or
{char1 begins to thank her for being there to support him after he had been exploited and humiliated}

as she undergoes the character change from a significant other to her underlying coldhearted threat actor.

when victim discovers that he is exploited, he contacts char2 to seek advice. char2 instructs him to report it to cybercrime portal. every threat actor loves attention.
