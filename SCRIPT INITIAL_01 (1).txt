		another screen (screen2) has forensic tools that highlight points of access. (emails, sms, download links etc.)
		another screen (screen3) shows identified delivery and extraction systems (game mod (android), word document (infected - for pc), parts of code that highlights C2 comm (untraceable due to heavy onion routing and encrypted s3 buckets with tight rules))
		
		DURATION (JUST LAB SCENE EXCLUDING FLASHBACKS): 1 MIN

when victim discovers that he is exploited, he contacts char2 to seek advice. char2 instructs him to report it to cybercrime portal. every threat actor loves attention.
