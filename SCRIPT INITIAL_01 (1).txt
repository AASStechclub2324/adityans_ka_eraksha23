	FORENSIC LAB SCENE

		char4 is bent over, taking a deeper look at one of the screens that sit on the workdesk of the of char5 as char5 operates the lab
		one screen (screen1) has the complete digital footprint of char1 in the form of a maltego graph with specific objects open/selected
		another screen (screen2) has forensic tools that highlight points of access. (emails, sms, download links etc.)
		another screen (screen3) shows identified delivery and extraction systems (game mod (android), word document (infected - for pc), parts of code that highlights C2 comm (untraceable due to heavy onion routing and encrypted s3 buckets with tight rules))
		
		DURATION (JUST LAB SCENE EXCLUDING FLASHBACKS): 1 MIN
		
		Dialogue:

		char5: Whoever it was, they were clever enough to be low key.
		
		Focus on each initial access threat vector with flashbacks. (WORD DOCUMENT, MOD APK)

		char5: Both devices have been rootkited with RATs. But I can't seem to trace where it calls back to.
		
		char4: That's because the C2 commands and information are proxied via that s3 bucket. Let me take a look at the rules
		char4 takes a look at the rules of the s3 buckets (iron clad rules 403 access denied). Tries to run ip trace on other websites. Shows up on various locations throughout the world, showed graphically on a worldmap as each ip is traced.
		
		char4: The rules are iron clad. And all requests to this bucket have been routed extensively. We can't track this.  There's nothing you can do.
		
		char4: Collect the malware samples, clean the devices, close all vulnerable ports.

		char3 walks over to the lab desk with an inquisitive but serious look

		char3: What've we got?

		char4: We have our hands tied behind our backs (frustrated, slightly angry)

		being impulsive, char1 downloads file, satisfied with himself for not having to do the tedious project by himself, and turns on "edit file" on ms word. a small window opens for a very brief period and then closes by itself as a metasploit reverse shell pops up on the hacker's computer. char1 doesn't think anything of it and changes the name and roll number on the cover page with a smug look of satisfaction.
		
	Scene: Phone bugging
	
	mid-day: serene lake side.
	char1 sits on a step with char2 beside him, both have phone in hand. mod game apk get's airdropped/social engineered onto the phone of char1 with the incentive of unlimited game currency. excited at this, char1 downloads mod as server side of the RAT lights up on hacker's computer. char1 shows to char2 that he has "hacked" the game and has unlimited gaming currency. char2 acts very impressed and amazed by her partner's skills.

		char1: while ordering, char1 receives a message from the forensic head to change the password of a particular social media platform that has been found cracked by the analyst team.
		char1: tried forgot password and receives OTP to change password
		char1: As char1 approaches table waiting for OTP, he looks around and spots char2's phone screen on the mirror, as OTP notification lights up on his phone as simultaneously a notification with the same OTP number and social media platform name lights up on char2's phone screen on the mirror


		char1's face gradually evolves into a SHOCKED AND SURPRISE one, with the HURT somewhere in there.
		as the fact becomes obvious, a COLD CONTEMPT settles over the face of char2

		char1: drops phone on table with a look of denial, a look that demands an explanation

		char2: (Gets up slowly wiping identifiable data from own phone) 

		char2: (still clearing data from her phone) You know, I never knew what to do with what I knew. That was, till I knew what really happened on the 5th.
		char2: Before you do anything (Kuch karne se pehle), I suggest you take a look at the contents on that (The phone). Leaves phone on table with a directory of exposing folders open on it, as char1 snatches it up quickly with a look of dread and fear. 
		
		char2 walks away from setting {face low, backpack, hoodie/cap/mask on}

		as char2 blends in faces with masks, we get the following voice over from char2

		char2 (VO): {char1}, the perfect exploit. 
					Blinded by popularity (FLASHBACK EDIT PHOTOGRAPHIC EFFECT), 
					naive to privacy (FLASHBACK EDIT PHOTOGRAPHIC EFFECT), and
					impulsive, (FLASHBACK EDIT PHOTOGRAPHIC EFFECT),
					oversharer (FLASHBACK EDIT PHOTOGRAPHIC EFFECT),
					But all he really is {PAUSE}, A VICTIM OF IGNORANCE AND DISREGARD.

Ideas:

	till climax meet between char1 and char2, char1 will not know the identity of char2 as the threat actor. upon meeting, 

{char1 asks char2 where she had been while his life was literally thrown inside out}, 
		or
{char1 begins to thank her for being there to support him after he had been exploited and humiliated}

as she undergoes the character change from a significant other to her underlying coldhearted threat actor.

when victim discovers that he is exploited, he contacts char2 to seek advice. char2 instructs him to report it to cybercrime portal. every threat actor loves attention.
