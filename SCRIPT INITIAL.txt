VO - Victim char1 POV

	Dialogue: (Scene 1) 
	
	Voiceover (VO) by victim, breaking fourth wall:
	
	char1 (VO): Hello. I know what you're thinking: "Who is this guy, and why is he talking to me?" Trust me, I'd rather not be here either, but you deserve to know my story.
	char1 (VO): No. This is not me. 
	char1 (VO): Meet {char2} ### FREEZE FRAME WITH DIGITAL NAME TAG ###
	
	char2 VO

	char1 (VO): The upper hand {NARRATION BREAK} - all of it is on the right side of the law. Yeah, it's legal.

	CUT TO BLACK. TITLE CARD FOR FILM (3-5 SEC)

	Dialogue: (Scene 2)
	
	char1 (VO): That's me.

	(background sound - usual friend group chatter)
	
	char1 discovers that he has been exploited

	char1 (VO): And that, is my life falling apart, the moment it all changed for me.


VO - Threat Actor char2 POV

	Dialogue: (Scene 1)

	char2 (VO): Hello, friend.
	char2 (VO): Your life, it's not as private as you think.
	char2 (VO): The digital world, it's full of shadows. And this - {pans FOCUS TO cyber surveillance methods on monitors (physical or digitally edited or a mix of both)} - 
									this is just a reflection of the world you live in - a world, where privacy is an illusion.

	char1 (VO): ... The upper hand ...


Ideas:

	till climax meet between char1 and char2, char1 will not know the identity of char2 as the threat actor. upon meeting, 

{char1 asks char2 where she had been while his life was literally thrown inside out}, 
		or
{char1 begins to thank her for being there to support him after he had been exploited and humiliated}

as she undergoes the character change from a significant other to her underlying coldhearted threat actor.
